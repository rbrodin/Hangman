# Hangman
Simple Java program I used to play hangman.

All .java files/classes are found under /src.

Created by Robert B - August 2018
The game is designed to take a list of movies (movies.txt), and play hangman with a random movie name.
The program is designed to work with any list of movies, and is seemingly reusable.
Enjoy :)
